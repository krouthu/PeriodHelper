Sriya Lingampalli for CruzHacks 2019.

Many women use period tracking apps in order to better understand their menstrual cycle. 
By recording this information, they can get a better idea of their bodies and their health. 
However, manually entering the symptoms and other important factors can get very tedious 
every day. We wanted to develop this skill in order to make this process easier. Period Helper 
aims to collect your data to transmit it to apps that can help predict and increase the accuracy
of predictions about a woman's menstrual cycle.
